              Eating fruit provides health benefits â€” people who eat more fruits and vegetables
              as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some
              chronic diseases. Fruits provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of
              your body.

              Fruits are sources of many essential nutrients that are underconsumed, including
              potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and folate (folic acid).

              Most fruits are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories. None have cholesterol.
